Instant Classic And Forefront killed it.  

We are so lucky to have welcomed these guys into the studio.  Instant Classic for their second full length record, and Forefront providing some support!  This was great time.  The guys did a medley of popular tunes and some classics that, all in all, grooved pretty hard.  It was a pleasure working with Forefront getting some really cool vocal percussion sounds... and oh man... that bass... He is basically the superman of vocalists.  

These guys can sing. Stay tuned for a new record.
