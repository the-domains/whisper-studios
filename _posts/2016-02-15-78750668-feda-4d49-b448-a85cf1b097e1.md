The Stoffs.

Eric and Brooke were in putting their finishing touches on some killer tunes.  I get to play bass, which is awesome. These tracks are going to be pretty solid.  The players are great. The writing is awesome. And the drum tones are stupid... Luke's 70's Gretsch Stop Sign Badge is the real star of the show.

While you wait for the record check out The Stoffs older material on Spotify.  A very different but very cool feel. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/525014d8-5b42-4d0b-a7b0-45c91507cf66.JPG)
